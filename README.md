# Amazon Clone
\* In progress \*

E-commerce site that will includes functions of Amazon including:

- CRUD operations on products and users
- User interface using ChakraUI

## Tech Stack
Framework:
- NextJS
Front end:
- React
- ChakraUI
Database:
- MongoDB
Authentication:
- Auth0

## To do
Need to refactor code to fit MVC architecture pattern. Currently, views are making their own independent API requests. A controller is needed to request data from API to pass into the views.  
Improve self-documentation
