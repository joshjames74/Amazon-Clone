Issues:
- /api/auth/me route not working. Once logged in, seems to work fine
- Warning raises with setting props in state of product card
To do:
- Set up user database

    - Create script to check if a user already has an account

Completed:
- Resolved product card issue by referring to props directly instead of adding to state
- Written functions to check if a user already has an account (incomplete)
